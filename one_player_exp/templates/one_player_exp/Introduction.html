        Instructions

    <p>
        You are invited to participate in an experiment.
        The experiment is part of a research conducted in the Industrial Engineering and Management Faculty of the Technion, Haifa.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment consists of {{ Constants.num_rounds }} trials, played one after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each trial, you will be asked to choose between an action (that provides a gain or a loss), and the status quo.
        Formally the two options in trial t are:

        <ul>
            <li>‘Action’: Gain of G<sub>t</sub> if event E<sub>t</sub> occurs; loss of L<sub>t</sub> otherwise.</li>
            <li>'Status quo': Payoff 0 with certainty.</li>
        </ul>
        The choice will be made by clicking on one of the buttons: ‘Action’ or ‘Status quo’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your payoff in each trial, is the outcome of your choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to be quick. You will have {{ Constants.seconds_wait_first_rounds }}
        seconds to respond in the first {{ Constants.num_rounds_long_wait }} trials,
        and {{ Constants.seconds_wait }} seconds for the following trials.

        If you are not meet these deadlines, one of the options will be chosen randomly.
    </p>
    <h5>Risks and benefits:</h5>
        <p>
            There is no risk. Your benefit is contributing to a research project.
        </p>

    <h5> Compensation: </h5>
        <p>
            You will get {{ participation_fee }} for your participation.
            At the end of the experiment, the accumulated points will set your probability
            to get a bonus of ${{ Constants.bonus }}.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your goal is to maximize your earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will get {{ initial_points_dc }} points at the beginning of the experiment.
        </p>
